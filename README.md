# Unity3D-GTA-Cheat-System
A cheat input system based off of the cheat system used in Grand Theft Auto.

This system took me roughly 20 minutes to come up with and there is room for improvement by using a dictionary and delegates to make it much more modular. If you are using a gamepad you may want to have a seperate poll system that builds a string letter for each gamepad button and feed it into this script. When adding cheats at the end please make sure that they are lowercase.
